A collection of Home Assistant blueprints

## Automations

- **[Aqara Smoke Detector Linker (Test and Alarm)](https://github.com/dagobert/homeassistant-blueprints/tree/master/automations/aqara-smoke-detector-linker)**:

  This blueprint allows you to link the detectors using Home Assistant.

- **[Aqara Smoke Detector Keep-Alive](https://github.com/dagobert/homeassistant-blueprints/tree/master/automations/aqara-smoke-detector-keepalive)**:

  This blueprint tries to keep the detector awake because otherwise it might not react fast (enough). Delays of multiple minutes were observed.
